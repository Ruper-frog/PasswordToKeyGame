# PasswordToKeyGame

## The file is supposed to be a website demo
which includes:

1. Home page
2. Register page
3. Sign in page
4. Update page (which u can only be accessed by getting the password 3 times wrong on the Sign in page)
5. and the game itself

Also as in a normal website, you have the ability to go through the pages by getting back with the left arrow and going forwards by using the right arrow

# in addition to the program class, I've added 2 more classes which are:
1. Display that is in charge of the main page
2. Keyboard that suppose to imitate the Console.ReadLine by using Console.ReadKey

## For saving the data, the file is using a database that holds all of the data.

# Things that I had to deal with and how I dealt with them
